# Memory Game Project

Welcome to my very first Memory Card Game!

The Game is extremely simple. It consists of 8 pairs of cards with icons. Click on a card to reaveal it. Match 2 cards together inorder to get a point. Try and finish the memory in as few movements possible. You'll be judged based on movements made. Try and get 3 Stars!

##Dependancies:

This game is dependant on Google Fonts and Font Awesome.

##How to Use

Just download the zip file and open up the Index.html file inside your browser. You should be good to go!
